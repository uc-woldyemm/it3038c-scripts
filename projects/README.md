- It's a code game where user makes a guess
- It defines the variable and asks user to enter their guess
- It will then check if the user guess greater number or lower number to generate the answer
- If user guesses greater than random number then it prints lower and it user guess lower number then it prints higher
- When the game starts it will loop and repat until guess is correct
- It increse tries by 1, each time loop repeats
- And it will ask user to try again
- Finally if the guess becomes equal to random number then it prints the winning result.
